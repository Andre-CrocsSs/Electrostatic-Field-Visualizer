# Electrostatic-Field-Visualizer
This project was made for the Electromagnetism I course at Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM as a final project on the course. The end of this project is to watch arbitrary electrostatic, as well as demonstrating Coulomb's Law and the superposition of the forces of each added charge.
